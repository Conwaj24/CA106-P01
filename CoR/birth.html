            The construction of the statue was funded by the sale of the equipment left behind by the attacking force during their retreat, worth 300 talents (equivalent to 7800 kg of silver at the time).
            The construction was directed by prolific sculptor and native  of Rhodes Chares with the aid of his teacher Lysippos.

            	The statue stood on a marble pedestal 15 meters high and at least 18 meters in diameter, it was either round or octagonal in shape. The feet were carved from stone and covered with thin bronze plates. the skeleton of the structure was made from forged iron bars, the skin was made from a series of square bronze plates 1.5 meters in length, riveted together. Much of this iron and bronze was reforged from weapons left behind by from the siege, it is also thought that one of the siege towers was used for scaffolding during the early stages of construction. Piles of earth were built up around the statue to access the upper portions and to help transport raw materials. Upon it's completion after twelve years, all of this earth was removed.
