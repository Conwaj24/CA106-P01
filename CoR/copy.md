####  292 BC - 280 BC

The Colossus of Rhodes was a statue of the Helios, Greek God of the sun and patron god to the island of Rhodes, to celebrate Rhodes' victory against the forces of Antigonus I Monophthalmus in the Siege of Rhodes. The construction of the statue was funded by the the sale of the equipment left behind by the attacking force during their retreat, worth 300 talents (equivalent to 7800 kg of silver at the time). The construction was directed by prolific sculptor and native  of Rhodes Chares with the aid of his teacher Lysippos.

​	A the statue stood on a marble pedestal 15 meters high and at least 18 meters in diameter, it was either round or octagonal in shape. The feet were carved from stone and covered with thin bronze plates. the skeleton of the structure was made from forged iron bars, the skin was made from a series of square bronze plates 1.5 meters in length, riveted together. Much of this iron and bronze was reforged from weapons left behind by from the siege, it is also thought that one of the siege towers was used for scaffolding during the early stages of construction. Piles of earth were built up around the statue to access the upper portions and to help transport raw materials. Upon it's completion after twelve years, all of this earth was removed.

​	The statue is thought to have been located in Mandraki harbor though its exact location is unknown. Amongst that sandstone blocks in the Fortress of St Nicholas near the harbor entrance are curved marble blocks which are thought to be remnants of the statue's pedestal due to their intricacy. Other archaeologists postulate that the statue was built on a hill overlooking the port as part of the Acropolis or Rhodes. Despite its many depictions in paintings and poetry as having done so, it is known not to have stood with one foot on each side of the harbor entrance as this would not have been possible with the technology of the time.

## Life

The Colossus stood proudly over the Mandraki harbor for over 50 years, proudly serving the patron god of Rhodes, Helios. However as fate would have it, in and around 226 B.C.E. Rhodes was struck by a horrific earthquake that toppled the titanic guardian of Rhodes.  

For a long time, the ancient Rhodians considered reconstructing the Colossus however, the priests of Rhodes warned that the Colossus had fallen because they angered Helios and rebuilding it would further his fury.
