            Even while laying broken the Colossus was still as impressive as ever.
            People from all over the world came to see the broken titan.  People were amazed by the sheer size of the statue,
             most statues were smaller than the Colossus' one finger at the time.

          However not all were so impressed at the  sight of the broken Colossus,
          when the Arabs under the command of Caliph Muawiyah the First captured Rhodes in 654 C.E. they had the statue melted down and sold to a Jewish merchant.
          A further testament to the gigantic scale of the Colossus was the fact that it took the Jewish merchant 900 camels to transport the melted scrap.
          Today the Colossus remains simply in paintings and poetry however, in 2015 plans were conceived to rebuild the Colossus and give the Rhodians back their harbor guardian.
