            The Colossus of Rhodes was a statue of the Helios, Greek God of the sun and patron god to the island of Rhodes, to celebrate Rhodes' victory against
            the forces of Antigonus I Monophthalmus in the Siege of Rhodes.

           The statue is thought to have been located in Mandraki harbor though its exact location is unknown.
           Amongst that sandstone blocks in the Fortress of St Nicholas near the harbor entrance are curved marble blocks which are thought to be remnants of the statue's pedestal due to their intricacy.
           Other archaeologists postulate that the statue was built on a hill overlooking the port as part of the Acropolis of Rhodes.
           Despite its many depictions in paintings and poetry as having done so, we now know that it could not to have straddled the harbor entrance as this would have been technologically impossible at the time.
