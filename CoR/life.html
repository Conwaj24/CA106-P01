            The Colossus stood proudly over the Mandraki harbor for over 50 years,
            proudly serving the patron god of Rhodes, Helios.
            However as fate would have it, in and around 226 B.C.E. Rhodes was struck by a horrific earthquake that toppled the titanic guardian of Rhodes.

           For a long time, the ancient Rhodians considered reconstructing the Colossus however,
           the priests of Rhodes warned that the Colossus had fallen because they angered Helios and rebuilding it would further his fury.
