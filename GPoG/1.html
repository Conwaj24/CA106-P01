      <h2>Construction:</h2>
      <h4>2580 BC - 2560 BC</h4>
      <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza was built over the span of 20 years, initially as a tomb for the great pharaoh; Kufu, who&#39;s sarcophagus would be deposited within one of the chambers constructed inside the pyramid. Specialists have estimated that the pyramid upon construction, measured 146.5 meters in height. However due to erosion, the pyramid decreased to the current height of the pyramid; 138.8 meters.</p>
      <p>Based upon the estimation for the time-frame of the construction, 808 tonnes of stone had to be laid down everyday. As the pyramid consists of 2.3 million blocks, that would mean that 12 blocks of stone had to be laid down per hour for a span of 20 years. The structure, made of both granite and limestone, is considered to be the most mysterious wonder out of the seven as it&#39;s secrets involving how exactly it was built remain hidden to this day. </p>
      <p>Theorists have speculated that the <strong>Great Pyramid of Giza</strong> was built by slave labour. However, recent discoveries were made at the camps of the workers believed to have worked on the pyramid, which could indicated that this wonder was in fact built by thousands of skilled workers. </p>
      <p>What makes this wonder so fascinating is the planning and methods of construction undertaken to finish this in such a short amount of time. Egyptologists believe that the workforce was split into groups of four. Each group pulled up blocks of casing stone with the aid of pulleys and ramps until each level was built. While these may be ancient techniques of construction, they have proven effective through the fact it is the only surviving wonder remaining.</p>
