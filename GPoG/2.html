        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p>Although the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only surviving wonder, it still has many mysteries which have yet to be solved; such as it&#39;s use. Archaeologists have come across chambers such as that of the King and Queen, the uses of which are yet to be identified.</p>
        <p><strong>The Chamber of the Queen</strong> is one of the most famous of shafts within this pyramid. While it may be called &quot;The Chamber of the Queen&quot;, experts believe it never was intended to store the tomb of a queen but was rather used to store a life-sized statue of King Djoser. Some have argued that the chamber was in fact used as a prayer room to Ra; the great God of sun, due to it&#39;s dimensions and fine limestone interior. While it&#39;s exact use is unknown for now, archaeologists are looking deep within the shaft with advanced camera technology to find Egyptian relics which may explain the chamber. </p>
        <p>In 2017 a group of scientists from &#39;<strong>ScanPyramids</strong>&#39; discovered a cavity within the pyramid measuring at least 30 meters long which has been dubbed &quot;The Big Void&quot;. It was discovered using three different technologies: nuclear emulsion films, scintillator hodoscopes, and gas detectors. It&#39;s purpose is unknown, however what stands out is the fact that, according to Japanese researchers from the particle-physics research group &quot;KEK&quot;, the void&#39;s construction is far more different than the construction of any of the other spaces in the pyramid such as the <strong>Great Gallery</strong>. Initially, upon the discovery of this void plans were put in place to drill straight through the thick rock to make way towards the void, however the decision to preserve the void was made, meaning we may not find out what&#39;s inside any time soon.</p>
