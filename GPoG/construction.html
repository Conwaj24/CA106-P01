            The <b>Great Pyramid of Giza</b> was built over the span of 20 years (between <i>2580 BC</i> and <i>2560 BC</i>)<sup>[1]</sup>,
            initially as a tomb for the great pharaoh; Kufu,
            who's sarcophagus would be deposited within one of the chambers constructed inside the pyramid. Specialists
            have estimated that the pyramid upon construction,
            measured 146.5 meters (480.6ft)<sup>[2]</sup> in height. However due to erosion, the pyramid decreased to
            the current height of the pyramid; 138.8 metres (455.4 ft).<sup>[3]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Based upon the estimation for the time-frame of the construction, 808 tonnes of stone<sup>[4]</sup> had to
            be layed down, everyday. As the wonder consists of 2.3 million blocks,
            that would mean that 12 blocks of stone had to be layed down per hour, for 20 years. The structure, made of
            both granite and limestone, is considered to be the most mysterious
            wonder out of the 7, as it's secrets involving how exactly it was built have remain hidden, even to date.
        </p>
        <p>
            Theorists have conspired that the <b>Great Pyramid of Giza</b> was built by slave labour, however recent
            discoveries were made at the camps of the workers believed to have worked on the pyramid,
            which could indicated that this wonder was in fact built by thousands of skilled workers.

            What makes this wonder so fascinating is the planning and methods of construction undertook to finish this
            in such a short amount of time. Egyptologists believe that the workforce was split into
            groups of 4, with each group pulling up blocks of casing stone with the aid of pullys and ramps<sup>[5]</sup>,
            until each level was built. While these may be ancient techniques of construction, they have proven
            useful through the fact it is the only surviving wonder remaining.
