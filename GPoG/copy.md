## Introduction:

The Great Pyramid of Giza, built between is the largest pyramid in the Giza Pyramid Complex, and of it's kind. Originally built to store the sarcophagi of the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh; Khufu, archaeologists and experts have discovered important papyri scriptures, and ruins which have lead to the recovery of, otherwise lost, ancient Egyptian history. Theorists and specialists alike have questioned **The Great Pyramid of Giza**, due to it's magnitude in size, as methods of construction at the time were quite limited, thus making it one of the most remarkable wonders of the seven.

## Construction:

#### 2580 BC - 2560 BC

The **Great Pyramid of Giza** was built over the span of 20 years, initially as a tomb for the great pharaoh; Kufu, who's sarcophagus would be deposited within one of the chambers constructed inside the pyramid. Specialists have estimated that the pyramid upon construction, measured 146.5 meters in height. However due to erosion, the pyramid decreased to the current height of the pyramid; 138.8 meters.

Based upon the estimation for the time-frame of the construction, 808 tonnes of stone had to be laid down everyday. As the pyramid consists of 2.3 million blocks, that would mean that 12 blocks of stone had to be laid down per hour for a span of 20 years. The structure, made of both granite and limestone, is considered to be the most mysterious wonder out of the seven as it's secrets involving how exactly it was built remain hidden to this day. 

Theorists have speculated that the **Great Pyramid of Giza** was built by slave labour. However, recent discoveries were made at the camps of the workers believed to have worked on the pyramid, which could indicated that this wonder was in fact built by thousands of skilled workers. 

What makes this wonder so fascinating is the planning and methods of construction undertaken to finish this in such a short amount of time. Egyptologists believe that the workforce was split into groups of four. Each group pulled up blocks of casing stone with the aid of pulleys and ramps until each level was built. While these may be ancient techniques of construction, they have proven effective through the fact it is the only surviving wonder remaining.

## Purpose:

Although the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only surviving wonder, it still has many mysteries which have yet to be solved; such as it's use. Archaeologists have come across chambers such as that of the King and Queen, the uses of which are yet to be identified.

**The Chamber of the Queen** is one of the most famous of shafts within this pyramid. While it may be called "The Chamber of the Queen", experts believe it never was intended to store the tomb of a queen but was rather used to store a life-sized statue of King Djoser. Some have argued that the chamber was in fact used as a prayer room to Ra; the great God of sun, due to it's dimensions and fine limestone interior. While it's exact use is unknown for now, archaeologists are looking deep within the shaft with advanced camera technology to find Egyptian relics which may explain the chamber. 

In 2017 a group of scientists from '**ScanPyramids**' discovered a cavity within the pyramid measuring at least 30 meters long which has been dubbed "The Big Void". It was discovered using three different technologies: nuclear emulsion films, scintillator hodoscopes, and gas detectors. It's purpose is unknown, however what stands out is the fact that, according to Japanese researchers from the particle-physics research group "KEK", the void's construction is far more different than the construction of any of the other spaces in the pyramid such as the **Great Gallery**. Initially, upon the discovery of this void plans were put in place to drill straight through the thick rock to make way towards the void, however the decision to preserve the void was made, meaning we may not find out what's inside any time soon.

## Modern Day:

Today, the **Great Pyramid of Giza** is one of the world's most renowned historical monuments for a multitude of reasons: Not only is it the only surviving of the seven wonders to date, but it is also a big source of discoveries especially within the scientific world.
