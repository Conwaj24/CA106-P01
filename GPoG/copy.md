## Introduction:

The Great Pyramid of Giza, built between <i>2580</i> and <i>2560 BC</i>, is the largest pyramid in the Giza Pyramid Complex, and of it's kind. Originally built to store the sarcophaguses of the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh; Khufu, archaeologists and experts have discovered important papyri scriptures, and ruins which have lead to the recovery of, otherwise lost, ancient egyption history. Theorists and specialists alike have questioned **The Great Pyramid of Giza**, due to it's magntitute in size, as methods of construction at the time were quite limited, thus making it one of the most remarkable wonders of the seven.

## Construction:

#### 2580 BC - 2560 BC

The **Great Pyramid of Giza** was built over the span of 20 years, initially as a tomb for the great pharaoh; Kufu, who's sarcophagus would be deposited within one of the chambers constructed inside the pyramid. Specialists have estimated that the pyramid upon construction, measured 146.5 meters (480.6ft) in height. However due to erosion, the pyramid decreased to the current height of the pyramid; 138.8 metres (455.4 ft).

Based upon the estimation for the time-frame of the construction, 808 tonnes of stone had to be layed down, everyday. As the wonder consists of 2.3 million blocks, that would mean that 12 blocks of stone had to be layed down per hour, for 20 years. The structure, made of both granite and limestone, is considered to be the most mysterious wonder out of the 7, as it's secrets involving how exactly it was built have remain hidden, even to date. 

Theorists have conspired that the **Great Pyramid of Giza** was built by slave labour, however recent discoveries were made at the camps of the workers believed to have worked on the pyramid, which could indicated that this wonder was in fact built by thousands of skilled workers. 

What makes this wonder so fascinating is the planning and methods of construction undertook to finish this in such a short amount of time. Egyptologists believe that the workforce was split into groups of 4, with each group pulling up blocks of casing stone with the aid of pullys and ramps, until each level was built. While these may be ancient techniques of construction, they have proven useful through the fact it is the only surviving wonder remaining.

## Purpose:

Although the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only surviving wonder, there are still many mysteries which have yet to be solved. This involves it's use. Archaeologists have come across chambers such as that of King and of the Queen. which their uses are yet to be identified.

**The Chamber of the Queen**, is one of the most famous of shafts within this pyramid. While it may be called "The Chamber of the Queen", experts believe it never was intended to store the tomb of a queen, but was rather used to store a life-sized statue of King Djoser. Some have argued that the chamber was in fact used as a prayer room to Ra, the great God of sun due to it's dimensions and fine limestone interior. While it's exact use is unknown for now, archaeologists are digging deep within the shaft with advanced camera technology to find egyptian relics which may explain the chamber. 

In 2017 a group of scientists from **ScanPyramids** discovered a cavity/void measuring at least 100 feet long, deemed as "The Big Void" within the pyramid. It was discovered using three different technologies: nuclear emulsion films, scintillator hodoscopes, and gas detectors. It's purpose is unknown, however what stands out is the fact that, according to Japanese researchers from the particle-physics research group "KEK", the void's consruction is far more different than the construction of any of the construction spaces in the pyramid such as the **Great Gallery** Initially, upon the discovery of this void plans were put in place to drill straight through the thick rock to make way towards the void, however the sensible decision of preserving the void as-it-is was made, meaning we may not find out what's inside any time soon.

## Modern Day:

Today, the **Great Pyramid of Giza** is one of the world's most renowed historical monuments, for a multitude of reasons. Not only is it the only surviving wonder to date, but it is also a big source of discoveries especially within the scientific world.
