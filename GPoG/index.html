            <b>The Great Pyramid of Giza</b>, built between <i>2580</i> and <i>2560 BC</i>, is the largest pyramid in
            the Giza Pyramid Complex, and of it's kind.
            Originally built to store the sarcophaguses of the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh; Khufu, archaeologists
            and experts
            have discovered important papyri scriptures, and ruins which have lead to the recovery of, otherwise lost,
            ancient egyption history.

            Theorists and specialists alike have questioned <b>The Great Pyramid of Giza</b>, due to it's magntitute
            in size, as methods of construction
            at the time were quite limited, thus making it one of the most remarkable wonders of the seven.
