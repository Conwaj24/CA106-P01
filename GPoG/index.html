        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>The Great Pyramid of Giza, built between is the largest pyramid in the Giza Pyramid Complex, and of it&#39;s kind. Originally built to store the sarcophagi of the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh; Khufu, archaeologists and experts have discovered important papyri scriptures, and ruins which have lead to the recovery of, otherwise lost, ancient Egyptian history.</p>
        <p>Theorists and specialists alike have questioned The Great Pyramid of Giza, due to it&#39;s magnitude in size, as methods of construction at the time were quite limited, thus making it one of the most remarkable wonders of the seven.</p>
