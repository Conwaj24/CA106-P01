        <h2>Architecture &amp; Engineering:</h2>
        <p>A fascinating part of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon is the feat of engineering that is the system used to supply water to the garden. Two different pump designs were viable in Babylonian times, where modern engines had not yet been invented:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Screw Pump:</strong> Also known as the Archimedes screw, it used a shaft angled at 45 degrees and the continual rotation of a large screw inside the shaft to push water upwards.</li>
        <li><strong>Chain Pump:</strong> A long chain wrapping around two cylinders would have had pots attached, that dip into the water, and move upward. The pots would then dump the water at the top and make the journey back down.</li>
        
        </ul>
        <p>Another fascinating aspect of the construction was the material used. A type of brick made of clay and chopped straw was normally used in the construction of buildings in Babylon, but this material couldn&#39;t hold up against the water pumped into the gardens.</p>
        <p>	Stone was scarce, so to combat this issue they laid multiple layers of asphalt and tiles, on top of which they placed a layer of lead. This formed the foundation on which they put dirt and planted the trees which impressed many Babylonians in its time.</p>
