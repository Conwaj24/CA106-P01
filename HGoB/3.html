        <h2>Destruction:</h2>
        <h4>Date unknown</h4>
        <p>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon suffers the peculiar case of being the only Wonder of the World whose location hasn&#39;t yet been established, due to a lack of archaeological evidence.</p>
        <p>	Some hypothesize that the Gardens did not exist at all, rather being a legendary work of fiction, described in poetry. Some of the basis for this theory comes from the fact that none of the usual Babylonian texts, which are normally complete, make any mention of the Garden. Others still believe that the Hanging Gardens were destroyed in an earthquake during the second century B.C.. If so, the ruins would have eroded away with the rains and no evidence would be left, explaining why the archaeological evidence is so difficult to gather.</p>
        <p>	Whatever did happen to the Hanging Gardens, they were an impressive feat far ahead of their time, highlighting human creativity and ambition, even in ages of limited ability and great difficulty.</p>
