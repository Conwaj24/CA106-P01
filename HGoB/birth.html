            King Nebuchadnezzar II is told to have built the Hanging Gardens for his wife, Queen Amtynis. It is said
            that she longed to see the green hills of her homeland.<sup>[1]</sup> Queen Amtynis found the barren and
            flat terrain of Mesopotamia depressing.

            King Nebuchadnezzar ruled from 605 BC to 562 BC. The King was known to have ordered the building of many
            various temples and palaces. This was the height of the city's power and
            influence and King Nebuchadnezzar is known to have constructed an astonishing array of temples, streets,
            palaces and walls.<sup>[2]</sup>
