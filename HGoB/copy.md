## Construction:

####  605 BC - 562 BC

King Nebuchadnezzar II is told to have built the Hanging Gardens for his wife, Queen Amtynis. It is said that she longed to see the green hills of her homeland. Queen Amtynis found the barren and flat terrain of Mesopotamia depressing.

​	King Nebuchadnezzar ruled from 605 BC to 562 BC. The King was known to have ordered the building of many various temples and palaces. This was the height of the city's power and influence and King Nebuchadnezzar is known to have constructed an astonishing array of temples, streets, palaces and walls.

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon resembled a large hill that contained many species of shrubs and greenery. Interestingly, the exact location of these gardens has not yet been established, and some theorize that the hanging gardens were only fiction.

## Architecture & Engineering:

A fascinating part of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon is the feat of engineering that is the system used to supply water to the garden. Two different pump designs were viable in Babylonian times, where modern engines had not yet been invented:

- **Screw Pump:** Also known as the Archimedes screw, it used a shaft angled at 45 degrees and the continual rotation of a large screw inside the shaft to push water upwards.
- **Chain Pump:** A long chain wrapping around two cylinders would have had pots attached, that dip into the water, and move upward. The pots would then dump the water at the top and make the journey back down.

Another fascinating aspect of the construction was the material used. A type of brick made of clay and chopped straw was normally used in the construction of buildings in Babylon, but this material couldn't hold up against the water pumped into the gardens.

​	Stone was scarce, so to combat this issue they laid multiple layers of asphalt and tiles, on top of which they placed a layer of lead. This formed the foundation on which they put dirt and planted the trees which impressed many Babylonians in its time.

Clearly, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon is the most magnificent and beautiful wonder out of the seven, as the marvel of engineering in providing water to a large set of lush flora in the middle of a desert is still something historians puzzle over today.

## Destruction:

#### Date unknown

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon suffers the peculiar case of being the only Wonder of the World whose location hasn't yet been established, due to a lack of archaeological evidence.

​	Some hypothesize that the Gardens did not exist at all, rather being a legendary work of fiction, described in poetry. Some of the basis for this theory comes from the fact that none of the usual Babylonian texts, which are normally complete, make any mention of the Garden. Others still believe that the Hanging Gardens were destroyed in an earthquake during the second century B.C.. If so, the ruins would have eroded away with the rains and no evidence would be left, explaining why the archaeological evidence is so difficult to gather.

​	Whatever did happen to the Hanging Gardens, they were an impressive feat far ahead of their time, highlighting human creativity and ambition, even in ages of limited ability and great difficulty.
