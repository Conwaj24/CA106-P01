        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon resembled a large hill that contained many species of shrubs and greenery<sup>[1]</sup>. Interestingly, the exact location of these gardens have not yet been established, and some theorize that the hanging gardens were only fiction.</p>
        <p>Clearly, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon is the most magnificent and beautiful wonder out of the seven, as the marvel of engineering in providing water to a large set of lush flora in the middle of a desert is still something historians puzzle over today.</p>
        <p>Pictured above is an artists&#39; rendition of what the gardens may have looked like.</p>
