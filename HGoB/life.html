Upon his death the project was continued by his sister-wife Artemisia who also died before the tomb&#39;s completion, living only two years after her husband.</p>
        <p>The tomb was built on a stone platform at the center an enclosed courtyard on a hill which overlooked the city. According to <span class="tool">Pliny the Elder<!--These comments are to stop extra Whitespace

However it&#39;s size was not what was remarkable about the structure, rather it&#39;s near total adornment with statues and sculptures. The pyramidal peak of the building held a statue of Mausolus and Artemisia in a chariot drawn by four horses. The walls had <span class="tool">reliefs<!--These comments are to stop extra Whitespace

        <p>	It is though likely that adornment of the monument was continued by Mausolus&#39; descendants as historians find it unlikely that all of the work could have been accomplished in three years.
