        <h2>Destruction:</h2>
        <h4>1375 AD</h4>
        <p>Due to good engineering and future planning, The Lighthouse of Alexandria stood for 1,500 years. This was an impressive time for such a structure to exist, considering it was a hollowed out structure the height of a 40-story building. As a result, most lighthouses built today resemble the shape and structure of the Lighthouse of Alexandria.</p>
        <p>An impressive note was that this lighthouse outlived the Greek and Roman empires. It was since then absorbed into the Arab empire, but was pushed aside when Egyptâ€™s capital was moved to Cairo.</p>
        <p>Having been considered a safe haven for mariners for centuries, the Lighthouse had taken it&#39;s last few days during an earthquake sometime around 1375 A.D.</p>
        <p>Some bricks and blocks which had not fell into the ocean - were taken from the lighthouse and were used to build a castle for the sultan of Egypt. In 1994, French archeologist Jean Yves Empereur, of the French National Research Center, investigated the harbor of Alexandria and found at least a few of these blocks still in the water.</p>
