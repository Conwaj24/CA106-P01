            We are unsure as to a lot of features concerning the Lighthouse of Alexandria,
            but we do know what it looked like.
            As an icon of Alexandria, its likeness appeared in many places, including on ancient coins.
        </p>
        <p>
            Designed by Sostrates of Knidos, the Lighthouse of Alexandria was a strikingly tall structure.
            The name for this lighthouse comes from its location.
            The lighthouse was located on the eastern end of the island of Pharos near the entrance of Alexandria’s
            harbor.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lighthouse was tall - at 450 feet high, with three sections.
            The bottommost section was square and held government offices and stables.
            The middle section was an octagon and held a balcony where tourists could sit, enjoy the view, and be
            served refreshments.
            The top section was cylindrical and held the fire that was continually lit to keep mariners safe.
            There was a large statue of Poseidon - the Greek god of the sea, at the top of the structure.</p>
        <p>
            Throughout the entire core of the lighthouse, was a spiraling ramp that led up to the top of the bottommost
            section.
            As a result, horses and wagons were enabled to carry supplies to the sections.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is unknown what exactly was used to make the fire at the top of the Lighthouse.
            Wood was unlikely because it was scarce in the region.
            Whatever was used, the light was effective –
            mariners could easily see the light from miles away and could thus find their way safely to port.
