## Introduction:

This famous Lighthouse of Alexandria, once named Pharos, was built and designed around the year of 250 B.C. to help those at sea navigate the harbor of Alexandria  in Egypt.  Many had marveled it's precise engineering, which allowed the structure to stand at least 400 feet tall. This lighthouse is in fact, one of the tallest structures in the ancient world.

It was due to this solid engineering, that this building had stayed relatively untouched - for another 1,500 years. The structure was finally decimated by earthquakes in and around 1375 A.D.

## Construction:

####  210 BC - 250 BC

We are unsure as to a lot of features concerning the Lighthouse of Alexandria, but we do know what it looked like. As an icon of Alexandria, its likeness appeared in many places, including on ancient coins.

Designed by Sostrates of Knidos, the Lighthouse of Alexandria was a strikingly tall structure. The name for this lighthouse comes from its location. The lighthouse was located on the eastern end of the island of Pharos near the entrance of Alexandria’s harbor.

The lighthouse was tall - at 450 feet high, with three sections. The bottommost section was square and held government offices and stables. The middle section was an octagon and held a balcony where tourists could sit, enjoy the view, and be served refreshments. The top section was cylindrical and held the fire that was continually lit to keep mariners safe. There was a large statue of Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, at the top of the structure.

Throughout the entire core of the lighthouse, was a spiraling ramp that led up to the top of the bottommost section. As a result, horses and wagons were enabled to carry supplies to the sections.

It is unknown what exactly was used to make the fire at the top of the Lighthouse. Wood was unlikely because it was scarce in the region. Whatever was used, the light was effective; mariners could easily see the light from miles away and could thus find their way safely to port.

## Purpose:

The Lighthouse of Alexandria was built in the city of Alexandria, Egypt, just 20 miles west of the Nile River. the city of Alexandria was founded in 332 B.C. Alexandria was in prime location to be a major Mediterranean port, and this helped infrastructure in the city. Alexandria was in fact, one of the most important cities of the ancient world, including its famous library.

One of Alexandria's few negative features was the surrounding rocks and shoals on the approach to Alexandria’s harbor. In one grand statement, Alexander the Great's successor - Ptolemy Soter ordered a lighthouse to be built. This was in fact, one of the first buildings ever built solely to be a lighthouse.

The construction of this lighthouse was to take approximately 40 years. The construction was finally completed around 250 B.C.

## Destruction:

#### 1375 AD

Due to good engineering and future planning, The Lighthouse of Alexandria stood for 1,500 years. This was an impressive time for such a structure to exist, considering it was a hollowed out structure the height of a 40-story building. As a result, most lighthouses built today resemble the shape and structure of the Lighthouse of Alexandria.

An impressive note was that this lighthouse outlived the Greek and Roman empires. It was since then absorbed into the Arab empire, but was pushed aside when Egypt’s capital was moved to Cairo.

Having been considered a safe haven for mariners for centuries, the Lighthouse had taken it's last few days during an earthquake sometime around 1375 A.D.

Some bricks and blocks which had not fell into the ocean - were taken from the lighthouse and were used to build a castle for the sultan of Egypt. In 1994, French archeologist Jean Yves Empereur, of the French National Research Center, investigated the harbor of Alexandria and found at least a few of these blocks still in the water.
