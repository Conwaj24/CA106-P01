            The LightHouse of Alexandria was built in the city of Alexandria, Egypt, just 20 miles west of the Nile
            River.
            the city of Alexandria was founded in 332 B.C.
            Alexandria was in prime location to be a major Mediterranean port, and this helped infrastructure in the
            city.
            Alexandria was in fact, one of the most important cities of the ancient world, including its famous
            library.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of Alexandria's few negative features was the surrounding rocks and shoals on the approach to
            Alexandriaâ€™s harbor.
            In one grand statement, Alexander the Great's successor - Ptolemy Soter ordered a lighthouse to be built.
            This was in fact, one of the first buildings ever built solely to be a lighthouse.
        </p>
        <p>
            The construction of this lighthouse was to take approximately 40 years.
            The construction was finally completed around 250 B.C.</p>
