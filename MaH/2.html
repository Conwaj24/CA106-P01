            <p>
                It is thought likely that adornment of the monument was continued by Mausolus&#39;s descendants as historians find it unlikely that all of the work could have been accomplished in three years. Most of what historians know about the construction comes from historical writings rather than ruins and as such there are many interpretations of what the Mausoleum may have looked like.
                <br>
                The Monument stood for sixteen centuries, surviving both the conquest of Alexander the Great and numerous pirate raids.
