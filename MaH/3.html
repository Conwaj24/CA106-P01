        <h2>Destruction:</h2>
        <p>
            It is unknown exactly how the Mausoleum fell to ruin but it is commonly thought that it was destroyed by a series of earthquakes sometime after Eustathius&#39;s writing of the monument in the 12th century AD. From the writings of the Kights of St. John of Jerusalem it is known that only the base of the Tomb was recognizable by their arrival in 1404 AD.
            <br>
            The remains of the mausoleum were used by the Knights to fortify Bodrum Castle in 1494. Many reliefs were also recovered from the rubble to be used as decoration. The castle was further fortified in 1522 by the same means following rumors of a Turkish invasion.
