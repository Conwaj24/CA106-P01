The Hanging Gardens of Babylon resembled a large hill that contained many species of shrubs and greenery. Interestingly, the exact location of these gardens has not yet been established, and some theorize that the hanging gardens were only fiction.

​	Clearly, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon is the most magnificent and beautiful wonder out of the seven, as the marvel of engineering in providing water to a large set of lush flora in the middle of a desert is still something historians puzzle over today. Pictured above is an artists' rendition of what the gardens may have looked like.

## Construction:

####  605 BC - 562 BC

King Nebuchadnezzar II is told to have built the Hanging Gardens for his wife, Queen Amtynis. It is said that she longed to see the green hills of her homeland.<sup>[1]</sup> Queen Amtynis found the barren and flat terrain of Mesopotamia depressing.

​	King Nebuchadnezzar ruled from 605 BC to 562 BC. The King was known to have ordered the building of many various temples and palaces. This was the height of the city's power and influence and King Nebuchadnezzar is known to have constructed an astonishing array of temples, streets, palaces and walls.

## Destruction:

#### Date unknown

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon suffers the peculiar case of being the only Wonder of the World whose location hasn't yet been established, due to a lack of archaeological evidence.

​	Some hypothesize that the Gardens did not exist at all, rather being a legendary work of fiction, described in poetry. Some of the basis for this theory comes from the fact that none of the usual Babylonian texts, which are normally complete, make any mention of the Garden. Others still believe that the Hanging Gardens were destroyed in an earthquake during the second century B.C.. If so, the ruins would have eroded away with the rains and no evidence would be left, explaining why the archaeological evidence is so difficult to gather.

​	Whatever did happen to the Hanging Gardens, they were an impressive feat far ahead of their time, highlighting human creativity and ambition, even in ages of limited ability and great difficulty.
