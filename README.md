# Seven Wonders of the World

## Specs:
- We gotta make 4 sections, of which there should be 5 pages.


## Roles:

| Name                       | Role                           |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Gytis Daujotas (Orbotex)   | The Hanging Gardens of Babylon |
| Brendan Mannion (ironTuna) | The Lighthouse of Alexandria   |
| Maciej Sweriad (Wolfering) | The Colossus of Rhodes         |
| Kevin Daniel (Prada)       | The Great Pyramid of Giza      |

That leaves the following:

5. The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus;
6. The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus;
7. The Statue of Zeus at Olympia;

We also need a member of the team to ensure that the website is conformant, designed well and flows nicely.


## Remember:
- Watch out for text *and* code plagiarism.
- We need to keep this site relatively simple.
- Each section should have a similar look and feel to the next.
