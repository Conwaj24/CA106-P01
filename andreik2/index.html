                    <p>My name as you probably know is <b>Kevin Daniel</b>. There's not much to me, however I do have a deep interest in anything blockchain related and anything infosec too.</p>

                    <p>I'm currently in my first year at <a href = "https://www.dcu.ie">Dublin City University</a> studying <a href = "https://www.dcu.ie/courses/undergraduate/computing/computer-applications.shtml">Computer Applications</a> which is a four year programme. I have intentions to continue my Information Security studies alongside my degree, and are hoping to obtain the <b>Certified Ethical Hacker</b> certification fairly soon.</p>

                        <p>For me personally, it's less about the financial aspect of Crypto, and more about the technology.</p>
                        <p>I strongly believe that over time, blockchain will slowly overrule the standard ledger we know today.</p>
                        <p>Having a public ledger, such as in the case of Bitcoin, will help the world from problems such as corruption.</p>
                        <p>I've worked on a series of projects, and are involved in the managment of several ICOs. You probably won't find someone else my age as interested in this field as myself.</p>

                        <p>The internet should be a place where one can freely roam without any consequences and without any fears. </p>
                        <p>We should stride to fight cyber crime, and turn the cyber world into a cyber dystopia.</p>

                        <p>Privacy is extremely important to me. Seeing who has access to your data, and why is key to securing your digital identity.</p>
                        <p>Prioritize your privacy over anything else before someone else prioritizes it for you without your consent.</p>
