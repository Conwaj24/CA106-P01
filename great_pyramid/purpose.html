            Although the <b>Great Pyramid of Giza</b> is the only surviving wonder, there are still many mysteries which have yet to be solved. This involves it's use. Archaeologists have come across <i>chambers</i>
            such as that of <b>King</b> and of the <b>Queen.</b> which their uses are yet to be identified.
          </p>

            <b>The Chamber of the Queen</b>, is one of the most famous of shafts within this pyramid. While it may be called "The Chamber of the Queen", experts believe it never was intended to store the tomb of a queen, but
            was rather used to store a life-sized statue of King Djoser.<sup>[1]</sup> Some have argued that the chamber was in fact used as a prayer room to Ra, the great God of sun due to it's dimensions and fine limestone interior. While
            it's exact use is unknown for now, archaeologists are digging deep within the shaft with advanced camera technology to find egyptian relics which may explain the chamber.

            In <i>2017</i> a group of scientists from <b>ScanPyramids</b> discovered a cavity/void measuring at least 100 feet long, deemed as "The Big Void" within the pyramid.<sup>[2]</sup> It was discovered using three different technologies: nuclear emulsion films, scintillator hodoscopes, and gas detectors.
            It's purpose is unknown, however what stands out is the fact that, according to Japanese researchers from the particle-physics research group "KEK", the void's consruction is far more different than the construction of any of the construction spaces in the pyramid such as the <b>Great Gallery</b>.
            Initially, upon the discovery of this void plans were put in place to drill straight through the thick rock to make way towards the void, however the sensible decision of preserving the void as-it-is was made, meaning we may not find out what's inside any time soon.
