            Some theorize that the Hanging Gardens were destroyed in an earthquake during the second century B.C.. If
            so, the ruins would have eroded away with the rains and no evidence would be left, explaining why the
            archealogical evidence is so difficult to gather. <sup>[1]</sup>

            Whatever did happen to the Hanging Gardens, they were an impressive feat far ahead of their time,
            highlighting human creativity and ambition, even in ages of limited ability and great difficulty.
