            The Hanging Gardens of Babylon resembled a large hill that contained many species of shrubs and greenery.<sup>[1]</sup>
            Interestingly, the exact location of these gardens has not yet been established, and some theorize that the
            hanging gardens were only fiction.

            Clearly, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon is the most magnificent and beautiful wonder out of the seven, as
            the marvel of engineering in providing water to a large set of lush flora in the middle of a desert is
            still something historians puzzle over today.
