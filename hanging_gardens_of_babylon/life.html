        <p>A fascinating part of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon is the feat of engineering that is the system used to
            supply water to the garden.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
        <p>Two different pump designs were viable in Babylonian times, where modern engines had not yet been invented.</p>
        <ol>

                <strong>Screw Pump:</strong> Also known as the Archimedes screw, it used a shaft angled at 45 degrees
                and the continual rotation of a large screw inside the shaft to push water upwards.<sup>[2]</sup>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Chain Pump:</strong> A long chain wrapping around two cylinders would have had pots attatched,
                that dip into the water, and move upward. The pots would then dump the water at the top and make the
                journey back down.<sup>[3]</sup>
