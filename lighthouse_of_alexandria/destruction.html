<h2>Destruction</h2>
<div class="content">
    <p>The Lighthouse of Alexandria stood for 1,500 years — an astounding number considering it was a hollowed out structure the height of a 40-story building. Interestingly, most lighthouses today resemble the shape and structure of the Lighthouse of Alexandria.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, the Lighthouse outlived the Greek and Roman empires. It was then absorbed into the Arab empire, but its importance waned when Egypt’s capital was moved from Alexandria to Cairo.</p>
    <p>Having kept mariners safe for centuries, the Lighthouse of Alexandria was finally destroyed by an earthquake sometime around 1375 A.D.</p>
    <p>Some of its blocks were taken and used to build a castle for the sultan of Egypt; others fell into the ocean. In 1994, French archeologist Jean Yves Empereur, of the French National Research Center, investigated the harbor of Alexandria and found at least a few of these blocks still in the water.</p>
