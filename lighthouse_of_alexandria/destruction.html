        Due to good engineering and future planning, The Lighthouse of Alexandria stood for 1,500 years.
        This was an impressive time for such a structure to exist, considering it was a hollowed out structure the height of a 40-story building.
        As a result, most lighthouses built today resemble the shape and structure of the Lighthouse of Alexandria.

        An impressive note was that this lighthouse outlived the Greek and Roman empires. 
        It was since then absorbed into the Arab empire, but was pushed aside when Egyptâ€™s capital was moved to Cairo.

        Having been considered a safe haven for mariners for centuries, the Lighthouse had taken it's last few days during an earthquake sometime around 1375 A.D.

        Some bricks and blocks which had not fell into the ocean - were taken from the lighthouse and were used to build a castle for the sultan of Egypt.
        In 1994, French archeologist Jean Yves Empereur, of the French National Research Center, 
        investigated the harbor of Alexandria and found at least a few of these blocks still in the water.
