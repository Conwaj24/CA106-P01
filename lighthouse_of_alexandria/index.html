        This famous Lighthouse of Alexandria, once named Pharos, 
        was built and designed around the year of 250 B.C. to help those at sea navigate the harbor of Alexandria in Egypt. 
        Many had marveled it's percise engineering, which allowed the structure to stand at least 400 feet tall.
        This lighthouse is in fact, one of the tallest structures in the ancient world.

        It was due to this solid engineering, that this building had stayed relatively untouched - for another 1,500 years.
        The structure was finally decimated by earthquakes in and around 1375 A.D.
