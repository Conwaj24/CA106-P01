    <p>The famed Lighthouse of Alexandria, called Pharos, 
    was built around 250 B.C. to help mariners navigate the harbor of Alexandria in Egypt. 
    It was truly a marvel of engineering, standing at least 400 feet tall, 
    making it one of the tallest structures in the ancient world.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The Lighthouse of Alexandria was also solidly built, 
    standing tall for over 1,500 years, 
    until it was finally toppled by earthquakes around 1375 A.D. 
    The Lighthouse of Alexandria was exceptional and considered one of the 
    Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.</p>
