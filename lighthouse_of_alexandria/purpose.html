<h2>Purpose</h2>
<div class="content">
    <p>The city of Alexandria was founded in 332 B.C. by Alexander the Great. Located in Egypt, just 20 miles west of the Nile River, Alexandria was perfectly situated to become a major Mediterranean port, helping the city to flourish. Soon, Alexandria became one of the most important cities of the ancient world, known far and wide for its famous library.</p>
    <p>The only stumbling block was that mariners found it difficult to avoid the rocks and shoals when approaching Alexandria’s harbor. To help with that, as well as to make a very grand statement, Ptolemy Soter (Alexander the Great’s successor) ordered a lighthouse to be built. This was to be the first building ever built solely to be a lighthouse.</p>
    <p>It was to take approximately 40 years for the Lighthouse at Alexandria to be built, finally being finished around 250 B.C.</p>
