                  <h1>About Me</h1>
                      <p>My name is <strong>Maciej Zamoyski Swierad</strong>, I was born in a small town in Poland called <strong>Nowy Sacz</strong>. From a young age I've had a massive interest in computing (thanks to my brother and uncles whom all work in the field)<br> I moved to Ireland when I was 4, and have lived  here ever since.  Most of my summers I spent in DCU in <strong>CTYI (Centre For Talented Youth Ireland)</strong> Programme doing courses ranging from Cutting Edge Science to Law. <br>After taking Law in my last year of CTYI, my plans of being a computer scientist shifted and I wanted to be a barrister, however in the end I ended up pursuing computer science anyway. One day I hope to master in the Bar of Ireland. <br>I've built and sold websites, I've participated in competitive programming and my plan after my degree is to work in Cyber Security, however my passion lies in authorship, and I hope to one day publish a book</p><!-- add your 150 word maximum About Me content here.

                    <h1>Work Experience</h1>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>SAP</strong>
                      <p>I had work experience in SAP back in 2016 for 2 months, there I learned to work with SAPs own language and also Java, they taught me the basics of computer science.  With them I also had the opportunity to work with cyber security and that's where I fell in love with it.</p></li>
                      <li><strong>Aviva</strong>
                      <p>Here I worked for 2 months in early 2017, I got to work with Machine Learning, and mostly automation.  I got to help automate monotonous paperwork that would take employees a few hours a week, that now instead gets done by the click of a button.</p></li>
                      <li><strong>Workday</strong>
                      <p>My most recent experience, I worked with them in 2018 during my sixth year in secondary school, I got to look at similar work as in SAP as they both work with cloud computing for the most part. Here I also got to learn what their HR looks for in interviews and they helped me write my CV.</p></li>
                      <li><strong>Phibsboro Credit Union</strong>
                      <p>I worked there for the summer of 2016 as a teller, had to deal with handling massive amounts of cash and dealing with people's loan applications.</p></li>
                      <li><strong>RS ROOFING</strong>
                      <p>I spent my 2018 summer working at RS ROOFING as a helper, I mostly passed around tools and learned how to bend zinc and other metals, because it was on a building site I had to get a SafePass training and manual handling.</p></li>
                      <li><strong>Website Freelancer</strong>
                      <p>I've made and sold websites, currently no website is online however my latest sale: rsroofing.ie should be going online soon enough, I learned HTML and CSS by myself about 2 years ago with the help of family members when needed.</p></li>
